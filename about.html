                    MoonSour's History
                </h1>

                <p>
                    MoonSour was created back in 2018 when an avid lego builder finished putting together his first gaming PC. 
                    He was instantly hooked and was looking forward to building another one. Unforuntately, he only had 50$
                    leftover from his first build... so not even a week after completing his first PC, he sold it and went deal hunting on ebay. 
                    With the idea of buying used parts, refurbishing them, and then putting them together to build custom PCs, MoonSour was able to 
                    build PCs at a low cost, and share the savings with local customers by selling at a low price. Over the years, MoonSour has built and sold
                    over 200 custom PCs using second hand parts leading to a 5 star reputation in apps like offerup, letgo, and facebook.
